                The perfect brownie does exist and it’s perfectly sweetened, extra fudgy, and just the right amount of
                chocolatey!
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup Challenge Unsalted Butter melted</li>
                <li>1 1/4 cup granulated white sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 cup light brown sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon espresso powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>3/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 cup semi sweet or milk chocolate chips</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk together the unsalted butter, granulated white sugar, and light brown sugar until smooth and
                    fluffy.
                </li>
                <li>Then add the unsweetened cocoa powder, salt, espresso powder, vanilla extract, vegetable oil, and
                    heavy
                    cream. Whisk
                    again and then pop in the microwave for 30 seconds. It shouldn't be hot, just warm. Whisk together
                    to
                    dissolve the sugar
                    and cocoa powder.</li>
                <li>Once smooth, add the eggs and whisk really well until combined. Beat for about a minute to help
                    fluff up
                    the
                    batter.
                </li>
                <li>Now add the all purpose flour and mix until you have a thick batter consistency.</li>
                <li>Finally, mix in the chocolate chips! You can mix them into the batter or another option is to
                    sprinkle
                    them
                    on top in
                    the pan.</li>
                <li>Transfer the batter to a 9x9 tray that's been lined with parchment paper. Smooth the top with a
                    rubber
                    spatula and pop
                    in the oven at 350°F to bake for about 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once they're out of the oven, allow them to cool down for about 25 minutes until set. Then cut them
                    into
                    individual
                    pieces to enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
